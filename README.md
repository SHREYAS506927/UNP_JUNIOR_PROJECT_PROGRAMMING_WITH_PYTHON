# UNP_JUNIOR_PROJECT_PROGRAMMING_WITH_PYTHON

I am Shreyas, and during my summer break, I completed a Python programming course from UNP Education. The course helped me learn Python from scratch, covering the fundamentals and practical applications. I had the opportunity to work on hands-on projects and even showcase my learnings during a demo day. I am grateful to my teachers, Padmavati maâ€™am, Palash sir, and Amar sir, for their guidance and support throughout the course, which made the learning experience both engaging and rewarding.
